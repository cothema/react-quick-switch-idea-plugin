# angular-cli-quick-switch-plugin

IntelliJ Plugin for switching amongst Angular CLI component files efficiently (e.g. ts -> html -> css) by just using one shortcut (**Alt+S**).

For example let's say we have a structure like this

    foo/
        bar.info
        foo.component.css
        foo.component.html
        **foo.component.ts**
        foo.md

By pressing the assigned shortcut repeatedly, the IDE will cycle amongst the files as follows:

    foo.component.ts -> foo.component.html -> foo.component.css -> foo.component.ts -> ...


Whilst cycling, unknown filenames (like bar.info) and extensions (like foo.md) will be skipped on purpose.

Explicitly whitelisted extensions are:
- js, ts
- html, php, haml, jade, pug, slim
- css, sass, scss, less, styl

Note:
For switching between your code and test/spec files, you can simply use the built in default shortcut from IntelliJ (**Ctrl+Shift+T**)



Further information:

If the default shortcut **Alt + S** does not fit your needs, you can of course easily adjust it in the keymap settings by replacing it for **QuickSwitch**.

Due to the nature of this plugin, it will of course also **work with other projects**, that have not been generated by Angular CLI - or are
not even Angular projects at all - as long as your project structure follows similar patterns.
